## Introduction

Spring Cloud Stream simplifies the process of building message-driven microservices. With Kafka as a messaging system, developers can create robust, scalable applications. This repository includes practical examples to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To begin using this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the command below to clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farel46/spring-cloud-stream-kafka.git
   cd spring-cloud-stream-kafka
   ```

2. **Set Up Kafka**

   Make sure you have a running Kafka instance. You can download Kafka from the [Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

3. **Run the Examples**

   Each example has its own instructions. Navigate to the respective directories and follow the provided instructions to run the applications.

## Features

- **Stream Processing**: Process and manipulate data streams in real-time.
- **Message Handling**: Efficiently handle messages with back-pressure support.
- **Multiple Bindings**: Configure multiple input and output channels easily.
- **Integration with Spring**: Leverage the power of the Spring framework.
- **Cloud-Native**: Built with microservices architecture in mind.

## Examples

Here are some key examples included in this repository:

### Simple Kafka Producer

This example demonstrates a simple producer that sends messages to a Kafka topic. 

1. Navigate to the `kafka-producer` directory.
2. Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Kafka Consumer

This example showcases a Kafka consumer that listens to messages from a specific topic.

1. Go to the `kafka-consumer` directory.
2. Execute the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Stream Processing

The stream processing example shows how to filter and transform data as it passes through the system.

1. Head to the `stream-processing` folder.
2. Start the application with:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.
- **Spring Cloud Stream**: A framework for building message-driven microservices.
- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
